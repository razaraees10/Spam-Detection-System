Engineered a Spam Detection System to automatically identify and filter out
spam emails from legitimate ones. Leveraged a Multinomial Naive Bayes
classifier for its effectiveness in text classification tasks. Employed
CountVectorizer to convert email text into numerical features, followed by model
training and evaluation. Utilized metrics such as F1 score and confusion matrices
to assess classification performance.
Conducted exploratory data analysis to visualize label distributions and identify
common words in spam emails. Implemented functionality to analyze
misclassified messages, aiding in the identification of false positives and false
negatives.
